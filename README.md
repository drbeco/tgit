@mainpage Introduction: a simple Prolog module to be called by a C program.

@brief This example shows a factorial function written in prolog that can be called by a C program.

@details

Sometimes a task is too much high level to be implemented in pure C (although its always possible, as C is such a universal language). In that case you might want to call a library written in another language.

Prolog is just one of so many languages that smoothly integrates with C. What makes Prolog special is its ability to proccess high levels of knowledge, iterate, deduct facts, and so on. Also, its list proccessing       capacity is pretty amazing (that alone would justify its use together with a C program).

Now, how to do that? Easy. Just take a look at this example. It has all you need to start. Source is available.

Use it as a skeleton for your work.

@par In appreciation,

Dr. Beco
